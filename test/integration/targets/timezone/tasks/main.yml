# Because hwclock usually isn't available inside Docker containers in Shippable
# these tasks will detect if hwclock works and only run hwclock tests if it is
# supported. That is why it is recommended to run these tests locally with
# `--docker-privileged` on centos6, centos7 and ubuntu1404 images. Example
# command to run on centos6:
#
#   ansible-test integration --docker centos6 --docker-privileged -v timezone

##
## set path to timezone config files
##

- name: set config file path on Debian
  set_fact:
    timezone_config_file: '/etc/timezone'
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: set config file path on RedHat
  set_fact:
    timezone_config_file: '/etc/sysconfig/clock'
  when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'
